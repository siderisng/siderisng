### Hi there 👋

🌍 &nbsp;&nbsp; Thessaloniki      

🖥️ &nbsp;&nbsp; Working as a full-stack developer, specializing in the Frontend space 

📚 &nbsp;&nbsp; Coding with Javascript (Vue.js, React), PHP, Python, HTML, CSS & more   

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=siderisng&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true&show_icons=true&theme=bear&layout=compact&langs_count=7)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

_NOTE: Top Languages does not indicate my skill level or anything like that, it's a GitHub metric of which languages I used the most on public projects on GitHub (private repos are not included)._
